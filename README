IndoorNav
=========

IndoorNav should demonstrate indoor positioning with image fingerprinting algorithms.

**This is the mobile part of the application**

To run IndoorNav a Server called IndoorNavS is required. He processes images taken by IndoorNav and tries to determine the position where the image was taken.

Requirements
-----------

*IndoorNav requires "Mock Locations" to work properly. As we publish our position to the LocationProvider of the Android System.
*Tiles with zoomlevel 10 to 20 have to be put in a .zip-File and transfered to your mobile device under /mnt/sdcard/osmdroid/[someTiles].zip
